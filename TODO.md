This file lists the know issues with rtf_title tagset.

The TOC entries are not shown in the navigation window in Word 2013.

The total number of pages is wrong when there is a table of contents.
Workaround: remove the first section break after the TOC.

The pages may overflow.
Workaround: a) change SAS code to force pagebreaks, b) in Word increase margins, and following that delete empty pages occuring due to the resize of margins.
